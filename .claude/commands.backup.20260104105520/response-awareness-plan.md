# /response-awareness-plan — Planning-Only Blueprint

Use this when you need to design an approach before implementation (multi-system changes, risky migrations, unclear requirements).

## How to run

`/response-awareness-plan "<task description>"`

## Output requirements

Produce a concise blueprint that includes:
- Target state + non-goals
- Key decisions and tradeoffs
- Step-by-step implementation plan (ordered)
- Files/modules likely to change
- Test plan (exact commands)
- Rollback / failure modes (if applicable)
